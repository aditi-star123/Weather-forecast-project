# Weather-forecast-project


## Project Overview
This is a web-based application that provides users with real-time weather forecasts for their location or a specified city. The app aims to display weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed using a user-friendly interface.

### Status: ðŸš§ Work in Progress
Currently, this project is in the **early stages of development**. Only some core files and basic structure have been added. Here's what has been done so far:

- **Initial HTML, CSS, and JS setup**: The skeleton of the project, including basic design and layout, is in place.
- **Basic API setup**: Early-stage integration of the weather API has been started but not yet fully functional.
- **UI Design**: Simple design using HTML and CSS. More improvements will be made in upcoming commits.
